# 2D-Muscle-Strain-Analysis-Using-HARP
This code uses the Harmonic Phase Analysis (HARP) method and shows a colormap of strain in a specified region of interest in the scan. The HARP code is entirely taken from the Image Analysis and Communications Lab of Johns Hopkins University. Data from this code is further processed to meet specific needs. 

All the codes should be downloaded to the same directory in Matlab. Read the HARP manual first and do as instructed. When you have saved the results from the analysis, open the HarpStrainAnalysis.m file and read through the instructions there.
